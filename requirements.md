## Summary

This document defines the **requirements** for three core backend features of the Airbnb Clone:
1. **User Authentication** (secure login/register)
2. **Property Management** (listing and searching properties)
3. **Booking System** (reserving and managing bookings)

These requirements will serve as the foundation for implementing the backend API.
